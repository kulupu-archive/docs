A proof of work blockchain built on the Substrate blockchain
framework.

## About Kulupu

Kulupu is a sister project related to Solri. Kulupu's goal is to
create a working proof-of-work blockchain built using unmodified
Substrate blockchain framework. Compared with Solri, Kulupu aims to
take a more practical approach of an on-chain governed self-updating
blockchain, while Solri maintains the ideal minimalist blockchain
design.

The consensus engine for Kulupu is the CPU mining algorithm
RandomX. For initial launch, the emission rate is fixed at one coin
per second. This, however can be changed using hard fork or on-chain
governance in the future.
